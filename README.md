# ðŸŽ¨ Code Art with CSS, p5.js & Manim

This is a collection of my creative coding experiments â€” starting with **CSS and HTML**, and expanding into *other frameworks. Each piece explores how code can be used to create visuals that are fun, expressive, and sometimes a little weird.

## ðŸŒ± Why this repo?

I'm using this space to:
- Practice creative coding
- Learn and experiment with visual frameworks like **CSS** and **Manim**
- Share art made with code in a simple, open way
